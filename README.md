# Hammett

Hammett is a framework whose main goal is to simplify building *commercial* Telegram bots with clear code and a good architecture. By commercial bots are meant such bots that require the support of
* several roles of users (admin, beta testers, moderators, etc.) to manage the visibility of some parts of the user interface;
* the permissions mechanism to implement a **maintenance mode**, **paywall**, etc.
* storing the users state in and restoring it from Redis / Valkey.

## Real-World Examples

To assess the capabilities of Hammett, you can take a look at some real-world examples. One such example is [TutorInTechBot](https://t.me/TutorInTechBot?start=github), which is a library of open-licensed books on Information Technology available in both Russian and English.

## Tests

To run the tests use the following command:

```bash
env PYTHONPATH=$(pwd) python3 tests/run_tests.py
```

You can also run the tests with coverage, using the following commands:
